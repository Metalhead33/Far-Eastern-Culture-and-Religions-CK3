 mithraism:0 "Mysterium Mithrae"
 mithraism_desc:0 "The Mithraic Mysteries were a mystery religion practiced in the Roman Empire from about the 1st to 4th centuries AD. The name of the Persian god Mithra (proto-Indo-Iranian Mitra), adapted into Greek as Mithras, was linked to a new and distinctive imagery. Writers of the Roman Empire period referred to this mystery religion by phrases which can be anglicized as Mysteries of Mithras or Mysteries of the Persians; modern historians refer to it as Mithraism, or sometimes Roman Mithraism. The mysteries were popular in the Roman military. Worshippers of Mithras had a complex system of seven grades of initiation, with ritual meals. Initiates called themselves syndexioi, those 'united by the handshake'. They met in underground temples (called mithraea), which survive in large numbers. It has been estimated that there would have been at least 680–690 mithraea in Rome."
 jainko:0 "Jainko"
 jainko_desc:0 "The mythology of the ancient Basques largely did not survive the arrival of Christianity in the Basque Country between the 4th and 12th century AD. Most of what is known about elements of this original belief system is based on the analysis of legends, the study of place names and scant historical references to pagan rituals practised by the Basques. One main figure of this belief system was the female character of Mari. According to legends collected in the area of Ataun, the other main figure was her consort Sugaar. However, due to the scarcity of the material it is difficult to say if this would have been the central pair of the Basque pantheon. Based on the attributes ascribed to these mythological creatures, this would be considered a chthonic religion as all its characters dwell on earth or below it, with the sky seen mostly as an empty corridor through which the divinities pass."

 canaanism:0 "Emunah Kənáʿanim"
 canaanism_desc:0 "Canaanite polytheism refers to the Ancient Semitic religions practiced in the Levant from at least the early Bronze Age through the first centuries of the common era. Notably, it was the religion practiced by the ancient Phoenicians who then disseminated it throughout their coastal colonies. Native Carthaginian religion is thus included within the broader heading of Canaanism. Central deities included El, the most high; El's consort, Asherah; Ba'al Hadad, a storm god and the central cultic focus of later Canaanite thought; and Tanit, a lunar goddess and the patron of Carthage."

 romancult:0 "Religio Romana"
 romancult_desc:0 "The Imperial cult of ancient Rome identified emperors and some members of their families with the divinely sanctioned authority of the Roman State. The framework for the Imperial cult was formulated during the early Principate of Augustus, and was rapidly established throughout the Empire and its provinces, with marked local variations in its reception and expression. As Roman society evolved, so did cult to emperors - both proved remarkably resilient and adaptable. Until its confrontation by fully developed Christian orthodoxy, Imperial cult needed no systematic or coherent theology. Its part in Rome's continued success was probably sufficient to justify, sanctify and explain it to most Romans."
 numenism:0 "Numenismus"
 numenism_desc:0 "It is difficult to reconstruct early Roman religion which consisted of a mixture of native Latin, Etruscan, and Greek belief. Much of Etruscan religion and mythology became part of classical Roman culture, including the Roman pantheon. The Senate adopted key elements of their religion, which were perpetuated by haruspices (divination specialists) and noble Roman families who claimed Etruscan descent. Greek religion also impacted the Italian peninsula relatively early, adopted into the Etruscan system around 750 BC."
